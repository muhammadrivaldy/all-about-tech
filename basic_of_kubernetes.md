## Overview

Kubernetes, called K8s is a platform open source for automation deployment, scaling and managing many containers. K8s is an abbreviation of "Kubernetes" in which "ubernete" are replaced by "8".

In 2014 Google teams state the project Kubernetes will be set as Open source.

### Let's throwback

* #### Traditional Deployment

  We don't have any mechanism for creating a bondaries between application inside of physical server. This approach raises a new problem, the problem appear because the server have many applications there. So, when one application used many resources in that server, another application will get impacted because they don't have a capable resource.

* #### Virtualized Deployment

  With this mechanism, we can solve the issue from traditional deployment. Why? Because with virtualized deployment, you can run multiple applications with different machines (called virtual machines). But, it's not easy to set up the physical server rather than container deployment.

* #### Container Deployment

  The mechanism of this initiative is really similar to virtualized deployment. But, Kubernetes more excellence rather than virtualized. Kubernetes is better at doing isolation applications because of that the containers are lighter than VM.

### Why used Kubernetes?

If you have many applications on your server, it will take a long time to maintain, deploy, and monitor all of your applications one by one. With Kubernetes, they will help you to maintain, deploy, and monitor easily helped by a system. Because of that, Kubernetes was born! üòÑÔ∏è

Kubernetes will help you with their framework for maintaining etc your applications easily with smaller mistakes.

## Kubernetes

### Kubernetes Component
When we install Kubernetes, we will get a cluster automatically. In a Kubernetes cluster, you will found several worker machines (called nodes) that running the container. Every cluster at least has one node.

Worker nodes host the pods that are the components of the workload. While the control plant will be responsible to manage nodes & pods.

### Kubernetes API
The main function of the Kubernetes control plant is the API server. The API server will connect the user, every single part of the cluster & the external components can be able to connect with each other. In many cases, you can do an operation with tools like kubectl or kubeadm. Basically, the tools will be generating your request in API format and send it to Kubernetes.

You also be able to request the operation directly with API through REST calls.
