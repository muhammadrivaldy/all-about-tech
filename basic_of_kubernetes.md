## Overview

Kubernetes, called K8s is a platform open source for automation deployment, scaling and managing many containers. K8s is an abbreviation of "Kubernetes" in which "ubernete" are replaced by "8".

In 2014 Google teams state the project Kubernetes will be set as Open source.

### Let's throwback

* #### Traditional Deployment

  We don't have any mechanism for creating a bondaries between application inside of physical server. This approach raises a new problem, the problem appear because the server have many applications there. So, when one application used many resources in that server, another application will get impacted because they don't have a capable resource.

* #### Virtualized Deployment

  With this mechanism, we can solve the issue from traditional deployment. Why? Because with virtualized deployment, you can run multiple applications with different machines (called virtual machines). But, it's not easy to set up the physical server rather than container deployment.

* #### Container Deployment

  The mechanism of this initiative is really similar to virtualized deployment. But, Kubernetes more excellence rather than virtualized. Kubernetes is better at doing isolation applications because of that the containers are lighter than VM.

### Why used Kubernetes?

If you have many applications on your server, it will take a long time to maintain, deploy, and monitor all of your applications one by one. With Kubernetes, they will help you to maintain, deploy, and monitor easily helped by a system. Because of that, Kubernetes was born! üòÑÔ∏è

Kubernetes will help you with their framework for maintaining etc your applications easily with smaller mistakes.

## Kubernetes

### Kubernetes Component

When we install Kubernetes, we will get a cluster automatically. In a Kubernetes cluster, you will found several worker machines (called nodes) that running the container. Every cluster at least has one node.

Worker nodes host the pods that are the components of the workload. While the control plant will be responsible to manage nodes & pods.

### Kubernetes API

The main function of the Kubernetes control plant is the API server. The API server will connect the user, every single part of the cluster & the external components can be able to connect with each other. In many cases, you can do an operation with tools like kubectl or kubeadm. Basically, the tools will be generating your request in API format and send it to Kubernetes.

You also be able to request the operation directly with API through REST calls.

### Kubernetes Object

Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes used that entities for mapping out the cluster situation. Especially, Kubernetes will map outs:

* What application (container) are running and on which nodes.
* Resources are available for those applications.
* Policy on how the app behaves. Like how the restart policy, upgrades, and fault tolerance.

If you wanna work with Kubernetes objects (for creating, modifying, or deleting) we must use Kubernetes API. To use it, we can use Kubectl or direct requests with REST API.

* #### Nodes

  Nodes represent the virtual machine inside the cluster. Every node will manage by the control plane and inside of the nodes it has many tools that we need to run the pods. In the real case, we are able to have more than one node in the cluster. Usually, for learning cases, we only have one node in the cluster.

  Creating a node on Kubernetes will depend on the cloud server that we use. The way to create a node on GKE & Amazon EKS will be different. But, in the learning case, we are able to create a node with a Kubernetes object. Please remind in your mind, this is not the best way to do it.

  Example of Kubernetes object for nodes:

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Node
  metadata:
    name: node-example
  spec:
    podCIDR: 10.200.0.0/16
    externalID: node-example-id
  ```

* #### Pods

  The pod is the smallest that we are able to deploy and manage inside Kubernetes. We can run one or more containers in one pod with sharing resources.

  Example of Kubernetes object for pods:
  
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: nginx
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.14.2
      ports:
      - containerPort: 80
  ```
