# All About Tech

Hi folks 👋️

All About Tech is a repository that I have to showing what I learned and what I want to learn in near future. Hopefully, it can be help us to learn something new easily rather than reading without any example of code. With Github, I can put more code and more example for us to getting more better context about the topic.

Like the title of the repository, the topic will around tech especially in the back end side. Why I created in repository? Because it's more easier to maintenance and grouping. Other people can contribute as well 😄️

So, let's start the thread! 🚀️

#### Overview

Design pattern is a solution to solving a common problem in software design. It's not only to solve one case, design patterns are coverage many cases in software design. You can use it as a blueprint, so it will be helping you to develop your code with a pattern. Design patterns are concepts, you cannot copy them into your program without an adjustment.

### [Class Diagram](./class_diagram.md) ![](https://badgen.net/badge/status/in%20progress/orange) ![](https://badgen.net/badge/version/v0.0.1/cyan)

#### Overview

With Class Diagram we able to imagine the system as a blueprint. The blueprint will maps out attributes, methods, & relationships between classes. So, you can analyse concept of model that you want before you start coding.
