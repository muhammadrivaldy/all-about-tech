# All About Tech

Hi folks üëãÔ∏è

All About Tech is a repository that I have to showing what I learned and what I want to learn in near future. Hopefully, it can be help us to learn something new easily rather than reading without any example of code. With Github, I can put more code and more example for us to getting more better context about the topic.

Like the title of the repository, the topic will around tech especially in the back end side. Why I created in repository? Because it's more easier to maintenance and grouping. Other people can contribute as well üòÑÔ∏è

So, let's start the thread! üöÄÔ∏è

## üß†Ô∏è What I learned

#### Overview Basic of Kubernetes (K8s)

Kubernetes, called K8s is a platform open source for automation deployment, scaling and managing many containers. K8s is an abbreviation of "Kubernetes" in which "ubernete" are replaced by "8".

### [Design Patterns](./design_patterns.md) ![Status](https://badgen.net/badge/status/in%20progress/orange) ![Versions](https://badgen.net/badge/version/v0.0.1/cyan)

#### Overview Design Patterns

Design patterns is a solution to solving a common problem in software design. It's not only to solve one case, design patterns are coverage many cases in software design. You can use it as a blueprint, so it will be helping you to develop your code with a pattern. Design patterns are concepts, you cannot copy them into your program without an adjustment.

### [Class Diagram](./class_diagram.md) ![Status](https://badgen.net/badge/status/completed/green) ![Versions](https://badgen.net/badge/version/v1.1.0/cyan)

#### Overview Class Diagram

With Class Diagram we able to imagine the system as a blueprint. The blueprint will maps out attributes, methods, & relationships between classes. So, you can analyse concept of model that you want before you start coding.

#### Overview SOLID Definition

SOLID design principles were promoted by [Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin). It's best-known design principles in object oriented programming. SOLID is acronym of 5 principles of:

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open/Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

#### Overview Code Smells

In general, code smells is not an issue. Even your code is have code smells, your code still working well. If we talk about "the definition of code smells", it will be refer to the fact that your code is not maintainable and not clean enough.
