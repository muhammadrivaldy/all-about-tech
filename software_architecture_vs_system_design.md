## Overview

I have been working as a Backend Engineer almost for 5 years. At that time I always focused on how I code as fast as I could and just learning based on what I worked on. After that, I tried to take a look at the overseas opportunities and I realized that my skills were not capable of reaching the requirement. I too focus on how to code fast without knowledge of "How the components interact with each other" clearly.

In this article, I wanna share what I learned and hopefully, it can help you to understand clearer about the software architecture and system design. Because both of them sometimes overlap and we made a mistaken understanding.

## What is software architecture?

The software architecture is a system that you present with a diagram and focus on how components will interact each other. It will help you & your team to research, analyze & define the services that you need before executing the project.

## What is system design?

Software architecture and system design are different. Scope of software architecture is described high level and organize the interaction between components. Then, scope of system design is to describe a component in more detail to help the others know it.
