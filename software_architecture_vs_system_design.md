## Overview

I have been working as a Backend Engineer almost for 5 years. At that time I always focused on how I code as fast as I could and just learning based on what I worked on. After that, I tried to take a look at the overseas opportunities and I realized that my skills were not capable of reaching the requirement. I too focus on how to code fast without knowledge of "How the components interact with each other" clearly.

In this article, I wanna share what I learned and hopefully, it can help me and you to understand clearer about a meaning of software architecture.

## What is software architecture?

Most people say software architecture is like a blueprint of system. In general, the software architecture is a system that you & your team present with a diagram and focus on how components will interact each other. It will help you & your team to research, analyze & define the services that you need before executing the project.
