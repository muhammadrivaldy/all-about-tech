## Overview

Before we learn about **Class Diagram**, we need to know the **UML Diagram** strcuture first. Because, **UML Diagram** has derivatives.
In this case, **UML Diagram** has 2 types (Structural & Behavioral) diagram.

We won't learn about **UML Diagram** in here. We will focus on **Class Diagram**. With **Class Diagram** we able to imagine the system as a blueprint.
The blueprint will maps out attributes, methods, & relationships between classes. So, you can analyse **concept of model** that you want before you start coding.

### Class Notation

Class will represent every component like **class name**, **class attributes**, & **class operations** (methods).
